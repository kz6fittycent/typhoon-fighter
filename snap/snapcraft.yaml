summary: Typhoon Force Storm Fighter
description: |
  Typhoon Force: Storm Fighter is a shoot'em up where you pilot a spaceship and 
  navigate your way through the end of the game by fighting swarms of enemies. 
  So far the game only features 4 enemies and has two short levels as it is 
  mostly a demo (the maximum score is 30900 for about a minute of gameplay), 
  so that I can get some feedback, but development is active so if you come back 
  next week (or even tomorrow) there  will likely be more content. 
  The goal is to make a game with 3 levels that have a lifespan each of 
  about 5 minutes, for a total of 15 minutes. 
  The final game will be released for free.

  The keyboard controls  are included in the splash screen, 
  but you can also use a Gamepad

  Keyboard / Gamepad (XBox button names)

  Start the game / Pause  Space / Start
  Move  Arrow keys / D-Pad
  Fire  X / A
  Move slowly  Hold Left shift / LB
  Toggle debug overlay  F12 / [only on keyboard]
  Reset game in debug  R / [only on keyboard]
